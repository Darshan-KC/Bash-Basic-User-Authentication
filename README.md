# Bash Basic User Authentication

This repository provides a simple user authentication system implemented using a Bash script. It demonstrates how to use user input and conditional logic for authentication purposes.

## Features
- **Username and Password Input**: Prompts users for credentials.
- **Hashed Password Verification**: Passwords are securely hashed using SHA-256.
- **Access Control**: Grants access based on correct username-password combinations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darshan-KC/Bash-Basic-User-Authentication.git
   ```
2. Run the script.
   ```bash
   ./login.sh
   ```
3. Enter the username and password when prompted.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple users.
- Brute-force attack prevention (account locking).
